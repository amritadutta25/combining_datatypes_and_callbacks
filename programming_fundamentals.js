// Read this article on programming principles, focus on the following nine:

// DRY
// KISS
// Avoid creating a YAGNI
// Do the simplest thing that could possibly work
// Don't make me think
// Write code for the maintainer
// Single responsibility principle
// Avoid premature optimization
// Separation of concerns

// Write a ~1 sentence summary for each one
// DRY: Don't write a piece of code again and again, that is, avoid repetition. Instead use constructs like loops, functions etc.

//KISS: Keep the code simple and readable. It is easier to write and debug.

//Avoid creating a YAGNI: Only write code for the functionality you need, nothing extra.

//Do the simplest thing that could possibly work: Don't try to write complex work. try to write a simple code that will do the work. This makes it easy to debug and modify.

//Don't make me think: Write simple and readable code so that other people can understand what the code is doing with minimal effort.

// Write code for the maintainer: Add comments and write the code in such a way that in future you or someone new maintaining the code will not have difficulty understanding it.

//Single responsibility principle: A part of code such as a function or class should do only one single task. Create separate code components for separate tasks.

//Avoid premature optimization: First ensure the code is working as expected before trying to go into optimization. Once code is working (maybe be slow) then focus on optimizing it.

//Separation of concerns: Divide the code into different sections with each section pertaining to a separate functionality.


// Which ones surprise you (if any)?
//Avoid premature optimization principle was a surprise because I always assumed it was important not just to make the code work but make it work in an optimized way.

// Which one is currently giving you the most struggle?
//Write code for maintainer is difficult to implement because when I am writing the code it doesn't come naturally to me that other people looking at it might not understand. Because when I am writing the code I have been thinking about it for a long time but when someone new is looking at it for the first time, the code might not be easy to understand at first.
